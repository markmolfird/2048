2048 game is a lite and easy-to-use web application for playing the 2048 puzzle game. It is built purely based on web technologies.

Just click on the toolbar button to open the game. 2048 has a 4Ã—4 grid table, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using keyboard arrow keys or by touch (on mobile devices). In every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
